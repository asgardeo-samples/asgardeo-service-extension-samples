# HIBP Password Validator Service with Express

This is a Node.js and Ballerina based password validation service that integrates with the [HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP)](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API to check if a password has been compromised in data breaches when a user attempts to update their password.

> **Note:** This sample is for demonstration only and should not be used in production. It supports the **Pre Update Password Action** of both [Asgardeo](https://console.asgardeo.io/) and [WSO2 Identity Server](https://wso2.com/identity-server/).

## Overview
This service implements a custom password update mechanism that checks if a password has been compromised using the HIBP API. It can be used as an external service extension for both Asgardeo and WSO2 Identity Server.

## Features
- HIBP API integration for password compromise checks
- Compatible with both **Vercel** and **Choreo** deployments

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (>=18.x)
- **npm**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asgardeo-samples/asgardeo-service-extension-samples.git
cd pre-update-password-extension-samples/hibp-password-validator-service-express
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Service

### Run the Service Locally

```bash
npm start
```

The service will be available at: **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

### Deploy to Vercel (Required for Asgardeo)

> **Note:** Asgardeo can access only internet accessible services. So you can use a Vercel-like hosting tool to host your service.

To deploy to **Vercel**, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a vercel account.
2. From the project root run below command to deploy the service.

    ```bash
    vercel --prod
    ```

    If you are setting up for the first time, the above command will prompt a set of questions. Refer to the image below.

### 4. Verify the Service
Run a health check to ensure the service is running:

**If service is running locally:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

**If service is running in Vercel:**

```bash
curl https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/
```

e.g.,
```
curl https://hibp-integration-express.vercel.app/
```

Expected Response:

```json
{
  "message":"Service is running.",
  "status":"ok"
}
```

## Configure the Action in Product

### Configuring the Action in WSO2 Identity Server
To integrate this service with WSO2 Identity Server, follow the step-by-step guide at the [documentation](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/next/guides/service-extensions/pre-flow-extensions/pre-update-password-action/).

### Configuring the Action in Asgardeo
To integrate this service with Asgardeo, follow the step-by-step guide at the [documentation](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/docs/guides/service-extensions/pre-flow-extensions/pre-update-password-action/).

### Considerations applicable for both products

When configuring the pre-update password action, consider the following:

1. Currently the sample only supports plain text password sharing format. Ensure that the password is sent in plain text format. As this is not safe, we recommend using this only for testing purposes. We are working on adding support for other formats (SHA-256) in the sample.

2. HIBP service will only accepts passwords which are SHA-1 or an NTLM hashed - [reference](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange). So, if you are using a different hashing algorithm, you will need to implement the hashing in the service.

## API Endpoints

### **Health Check**

This endpoint is to check if the service is successfully running.

- **GET** `/`
- **Response:** `{ "status": "ok", "message": "Service is running." }`

### **Validate Password**

This is the endpoint that will receive requests from the Identity Server for password validation.

- **POST** `/passwordcheck`
- **Request Body:**

```json
{
    "actionType": "PRE_UPDATE_PASSWORD",
    "event": {
        "tenant": {
